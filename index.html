            <h2>Calculator reflection </h2>
            <p> I completed a calculator project. 
                <ul>Things learnt:
                    <li>The dispaly screen for the numbers use a buffer - a concept where the input always changes and dependent on keys pressed</li>
                    <li>Use an event delegation to group keys together i.e. number and math operators</li>
                    <li>Use an accumaltor that tallys up the numbers + math operators - called running total function</li>
                    <li>Break things do to what like symbol vs numbers using <code>isNaN</code></li>
                    <li>Switch statements are a different way ti state 'if state'</li>
                    <li>Running totals, previous operators all accumaltors should be initialised with if statements</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>More about state variables and memory</h2>
            <p> I'm currently stuck on this coloured sqaures guessing game. Where first player chooses two colours.
                Second player will need to try to guess the colour and in the correct position in as few of guesses
                they can. The example responses look something like this:
            </p>
            <p> <code>(master) <br>
                    (master-check 'red 'red) <br>
                    'NothingCorrect <br>
                    (master-check 'black 'pink) <br>
                    'OneColorOccurs <br><br>

                    example2:
                    (master) <br>
                    (master-check 'red 'red) <br>
                    'Pefect <br>
                </code></p>
            <p> The exercise i'm struggling with modifying the response so that the output gives the response statement
                as well as the number guess made by the second player.
            </p>
            <h3> My thoughts on how to tackle this:</h3>
            <p> I was thinking along the lines of tally up/keeping count of the guess everytime master-check was called.
                There would also be a condition that states <code>(not (symbol=? function 'Perfect) then (+1 and reattempt)</code>
                So i'm trying to use an accumaltor because that keeps track and tallys, but i heading into road blocks with this.
                I know i need to modify the function the provides these response, but they will need to be an auxillary function that
                simulatneously keeps count of guesses i.e. a local definition ?

            <h2> GUIs, event listeners and state variables</h2>
                <p> This week i learnt about state variables with examples of GUIS i.e. address-book and 
                    traffic light functions. State variables are needed for programs that require memory.
                    In many GUIs, the variables will be changed, and the program will need to store its current value to memory.  
                    The example i worked through was adding to address-book or current traffic light colour changed to 'next' light colour.</p>
                    <p> <em> NOTE: I will use set! to change variables, once changed, every variable(x) will be changed to new value.</em></p>

            <h3> Event listeners </h3>
                <p> On frontend masters, i went through event listeners, which essentially is functions called once an event 
                    has occured. So a click of a button that sends an alert, or typing colour into the input box that then 
                    changes the colour of the box. 
                </p>

            <h3> Template for event listener function </h3>
                <p> Extract the variables : </p>
                <p><code> const = </code> <em> variable </em> <code>document.querySelector("<em> .class</em>")</code></p>
                <p> function call : </p>
                <p> <code> <em>variable.</em>addEventListener("what-you-are-listening-for? click/keyup/touch" , function ({<br>
                alert('alert-message'); <br>
            });</code></p>
            <p> <em>NOTE: There is event delegation where you can apply a call function to all events by using the parent element. 
                You would do this if you wanted the same alert when buttons on page were clicked.
            </em></p>

            <h2> New year new brain waves</h2>
            <p> This week is off to a rocky start, but I am attempting inexact numbers and understanding the pros and cons.</p>
            <p> This is what i have learnt so far:
                <ul>
                    <li> Inexact numbers in scheme are represented as mantissa, power of ten, exponent</li>
                    <li> these numbers are useful for dealing with small and large numbers within a set parameter i.e. 0 - 9999</li>
                    <li>Downfall is when there is no the exact equilvalent, it must be represented so it will need to be rounded</li>
                    <li>To multipy inexacts you multiply mantissas and the exponent together</li>
                    <li>To add simply add the numbers once convert to real numbers because some have a negative exponent which will affect the result</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p> What i'm struggling with now is trying to create a function that add two inexact numbers, i realise i will need to convert them to 
                real numbers first then add. But I have come across a road block as to how we convert the result back to inexact numbers.
                If the two inexact numbers have the same exponent that's simple addition, but if one is negative and one positive it become more complex.
                I will continue to look through stack overflow so see if others have similar issues, how they solved this.
            </p>

            <h2> Two weeks till christmas </h2>
            <h3>Frontend masters</h3>
            <p> I completed more videos on Javascript.</p>
            <p> <ul>
                <li> every function has a scope, if the variable is not used within the function and you try to call it outside of the 
                    curly braces it will not work. </li>
                <li>it matters where the variable is created because where the scope will be taken into account</li>
                <li> look for the curly braces when you're figuring out whether it is in scopt or out</li>
                <li> in JS <code>functions (name) </code> will be hoisted to the top same as <code> (var)</code>, var has a different scoping behaviour therefore var is not recommended to be used</li>
                <li> period (.) means you're calling function on to something also known as a method (a builtin function) </li>
            </ul></p>

            <h2>More vectors</h2>
            <p> To put it plainly this week has been looking back at the previous exercises around vectors
                as well as abstract running time. I havent grasped the concept of calculating the abstracting 
                running time. I will look into more youtube videos for this. 
            </p>
            <p> Functions using vectors is similar to list processing functions. You can use 
                <code> first </code> and <code> rest </code> i.e. processing two lists. 
                Upon researching, i note there are built in function such as <code> vector-take </code>
                and <code> vector-drop</code> which could be used for partitioning vectors - i have had 
                to use something similsr for structural recursion with lists.

            <h2>Vectors and abstract time</h2>
            <p> Vectors is like a list and there are built-in function within Dr Racket 
                but unlike lists, you can retrieve items using an index as opposed to going 
                from the beggining to the end. Practiced vectors using <code> (sub1 index)</code>
                where you use the 'list' type shape and recursion to find the index. 
            </p>
            <p> Abstract running time relationship between size of input and number of natural recursions.
                Here are a few described in the book:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>(define (contains-doll? a-list) (cond
                                  [(empty? a-list) false]
                                  [else (cond
                                          [(symbol=? 'doll (first a-list)) true]
                                          [else (contains-doll? (rest a-list))])]))</code> <br>
                                        It is dependent on where the 'doll symbol is within the list, therefore we average our
                                        likelihood to find 'doll' using <code> N/2</code>
                    </li>
                <li> <code>(define (sort-list alon) (cond
                           [(empty? alon) empty]
                           [else (insert (first alon) (sort-list (rest alon)))]))

                    (define (insert n alon) (cond
                          [(empty? alon) (cons n empty)]
                          [(< n (first alon)) (cons n alon)]
                          [(>= n (first alon)) (cons (first alon) (insert n (rest alon)))]))</code> <br>
                         Two natural recursing happening at the same time this is expressed as <code> N squared</code></li>
                <li><code>(define (maxi alon) (cond
                      [(empty? (rest alon)) (first alon)]
                      [else (cond
                              [(> (maxi (rest alon)) (first alon)) (maxi (rest alon))]
                              [else (first alon)])]))</code><br>
                            there are two recursions in the first line, so this is doubled with every original recursion - expressed as 
                        <code>2 powerof N</code></li>
                </ul>

            <h2> Braining out man</h2>
            <p> The last few weeks have been about generative recursion. This concept is somewhat different to structural recursion because it 
                looks at the problem at hand and asks "is this trivally solvable?" If the problem requires you break it up into smaller sections
                to then achieve the original outcome this is when you utilise generative recursion. I have utilised this with moving balls on a canvas, searching a binary tree and 
                using quick-sort.</p>

                <p> Also working through the next section of frontend masters.

            <h2> Brainzilla </h2>
            <p> I thought i would do some finger exercises this week. I want to reattempt binary tree exercises as it is a concept that i find challenging.
                Looking through the exercises again, i now understand that anything embedded requires a recursion. You will also need double recursion aka local definition to search within
                the binary tree and second recursion is for providing the output aka name of a node with the corresponding 'n'.

            <h2> Braining exercises </h2>
            <p> I have subscribed to frontend masters because i want to get started on projects to delve into html, css and java.
                My plan is to work on side projects i.e. making dashboards and websites to get some hands on practice. Frontend masters was 
                recommended by a few people in the industry. I'm only few videos into the begginner course with Brian Holt. I've already learnt better practices for 
                html.
                <h2>Notes to self</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Use <code> p tags </code> as opposed to <code> break tags</code> as sementic meaning is favoured over manual breaks.</li>
                    <li> Attributes is the first thing within the tag, they modify the behaviour of a tag by then specifying type + value. </li>
                    <li> <code> class </code> is favoured over <code> ids </code> because you can have multiple classes within html and reuse them for different styles.</li>
                    <li> You can have infinite nested <code> divs </code> but accessibility wise is good to have semantic tags too. </li>
                    <li> Functionally no difference between a div and article, but article specifies "heres bit of data/info", its newer in html v.5 </li>
                    <li> class is recommended to be used as documentation/label </li>

            <h2>Training my brain</h2>

            <p>This week i learnt about functional abstraction where if you have multiple functions with a similar pattern, you can make a generalised 
                function so that follows the same shape. You may also want to genrealise it further by adding re-op <code> < or > </code>. You can add 
                another function that defines the rel-op i.e. <code> (define (squared>? x c) (> (* x x) c)) </code>   
            </p>
            <p>I attempted finding the last item of a list using the local definition in the example
                last occurrence. It was a challenging concept as it requires a definition that executes a natural recursion to get through the list prior to completing 
                the function i.e. <code> symbol=?  r (first list1) </code>. 
            </p>
            <p> 
             Local definition is a concept where you can bind two function calls together i.e. sort where you need insert & sort.
             These definitions can prevent having to write multiple auxiallry functions if you are only required to use it once or twice. 
             you can apply local functions to make it easier to read within a function i.e. (define rest-filtered (filter11 rel-op (rest alon) t)).
             then you can plug that into the bigger function as 'rest-filtered'.  
            </p>

         <p> Processing two lists simultaneously, equality and testing have been the exercises i delved into this week. 
                It was a great summary of what i had learnt. There are three ways that this class of data can be processed.
            <ol>
                <li> if they belong to same class of data definitions i.e. two lists with single information, you can process as you would any data.</li>
                <li> if they have two or more pieces of information (typically a structure) within the list then you can process with a auxillary function</li>
                <li> if they require two seperate data defintions require four cond clauses </li>
            </ol> 
        </p>

        <p> Equality is about checking through lists of arbiturary size. The book suggests a punnet square to look at the symmetry.
            <ol> 
                <li> empty a-list - empty b-list </li>
                <li> empty a-list - cons b-list </li>
                <li> cons a-list - empty b-list </li>
                <li> cons a-list - cons b-list</li>
            </ol> 
            Then process each cond clause with the appropriate selectors (first a-list) (first b-list) (first b-list) (rest b-list).
        </p>
        <p> Testing function include the two lists as well as an expected result. It is suggested to use functions like <code> list=?</code>
        or <code> equal?</code>. Both of which process the lists similarly where it compared  the correspoding fields. 
    <em> NOTE: </em>
         For unordered lists you will need to sort th lists first and then process them using <code> equal? </code>
        </p>

            <p> I have dipped into more search trees. I completed some exercises that look into directories and files.
                It's starting to demonstrate real world scenrios, adding the complexity of different conditions/variables. 
                I'm enjoying this section, the wins and the struggles.

            <ul>
                <li> To understand the problem at hand will help organise where there a conditions i.e. lists in lists or whether it is a structure</li>
                <li> Pattern ive noted is lists require a conditional statement + recursion </li>
                <li> embedded lists require a structure (re statement) + conditional statement (ref structure) i.e. like a parellel recursion</li>
                <li> embedded lists within other embedded structures require four functions 
                    <ul>
                        <li> main structure 1 that ref the embedded list 1 + structure 2</li>
                        <li> embedded list 1 within main structure refers to main structure + recursion</li>
                        <li> structure 2 ref its own embedded list 2 </li>
                        <li> embedded list 2 refs structure 2 + recursion </li>

            <h2> Braining out</h2>

            <h4>Difficulty has amped, brain has exploded</h4>
            <p>
                The sections have significantly amped in difficulty. 
                I have dipped into binary trees and binary search tress. the difference between the two is search trees are ordered,
                whereas regualr trees are not. Which is significant to understand when trying to find a number within the tree. 
                Bredth and depth are some strategies used to search within the tree once ordered. 
            
                <h4> different search strategies for a binary tree </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> bredth goes across the tree </li>
                    <li> depth goes down the tree </li>
                </ul>

                I will like to reattempt the binary tree exercises because I havent nailed these concepts or created a function that works.

       <p> This week has been about natural numbers. I understand that natural numbers is what we know as <em> just</em> numbers. <br> 
        I worked through several exercises where I was sorting lists, using primatives such as addition with natural numbers. <br>
        I struggled with this week's topic mostly attempting to tabulate items and counting from a limit. <br>
        I am determined to revisit this topic and attempt the exercises again.<br>

        <h2> Ride the brain wave </h2>
        <p> Revision week ! <br>
            I did a couple of finger exercises to revisit structures and lists. I feel these will be important for day to day tasks. <br>
            It always surprises me that i missed a critical comment within the book that would have helped me solve a problem. <br>
            <em> Hindsight is 20/20 </em> </p>

     <h3> ✨ Hindsight ✨ </h3>
     <ul> 
        <li> list using <code> (first (rest list))</code> read from innermost to outer </li>
        <li> Use nested conditional statements when you are asking questions about the first element of a list, with f/up q's</li>
        <li> To extract information you duplicate the list using <code> (cons ...)</code>with a condition infront that excludes an element </li>
        <li> To search for an element within a list you can use a sumbol and place it in a nested condition </li>
        <li> Understand the problem, if you find a keyword <strong> "ALL"</strong> place a guarded statment to <em> exit</em></li>

            <H2>Wavy's brainy</H2>
            <p> This week was full of conditions. I was practice exercises pertaining to extract items from inventory lists <br>
                and creating new lists from old lists. The thing I have come to understand is that when we create lists from lists, <br>
                we are just copying the 'OG" list and refining it. <br>
            Recursion was introduced in this section. I think of it as a loopity loop to help go through a list. </p>

             <h3> ✨Conditional thinking ✨</h3>   
             <ul>
                <li> Lists with multiple colomns can be defined as structures, then you can use selectors to extract/modify members. </li>
                <li> Utilise recursion for the <code> (rest list/inventory></code></li>
                <li> To eliminate members from OG list, simply add function that excludes using: <br> 
                    <blockquote> <code> (not ( first list/inv-list)</code> <br></blockquote> </li>
                <li> then construct new (first list/inventory) <br> </li>
                <blockquote> <code> (cons ( selector (first list/inventory)) (recursion function)</code></li></blockquote>

            <h2> Brainy's wavy </h2>
            <p> This week was great! I moved more circles and rectangles using "clear circle" and "draw circle" function. 
                I have understood the syntax and grammar within scheme. Structures are a bit more complicated when is comes to mixed data but i think of them like lists 
                - where we use certain selectors to retrieve information.</p>

            <h3> ✨ Vibes of the week ✨  </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> auxillary functions are my friend and you should utilise them in variable data i.e. predicates and structures using conditions</li>
                <li> predicates recognise a form of data i.e. ?number to recognise number</li>
                <li> predicates help distinguish between different data within the structures with conditions i.e finding square condition within a structure about different shapes </li>
                <li> use predicates to 'check' the function i.e. checked-area-of-disk output should be a number, therefore number? will be used as a condition </li>
                
            </ol>
            <h3> syntax and grammar </h3> 
            <h4> Core grammar</h4>
            <code> <blockquote>( define (non-empty sequence of variables) expression )</blockquote> <br> 
            <blockquote>( define ( function-name parameter/s) body</blockquote> <br>
            <blockquote>( function argument/s)</blockquote> <br>

            <h2> Wave brain</h2>

            <p> The last two weeks I have learnt about Booleans, structures and making things move. Its interesting to know that you can compile different information into one file and <em> "name"</em> it. 
            There is a lot of be said about structures. I know that I've only touched the <em> tip of the iceberg</em> 
            Oh I've also learnt to move circles, but turning traffic lights "on and off" is work in progress. </p>

            <h3>  Week of waving</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li> structures contain different types of information i.e. pixel : x,y coordinate, circle : coordinate, radius, colour </li>
                <li> Booleans only return true / false </li>
                <li> When composing function you must work from inner most bracket to outer</li>
                <li>  when placing a condition that has two functions you must return the first function with "true" so that you can envoke the 2nd function</li>
                <li> make an axillary function for when the code starts to become long; almost like <em> step by step </em> process </li>
            </ol>

            <h3> ✨ dark thoughts ✨</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li> moving a circle is more difficult than one anticipates </li>
                <li> the feeling when there's no syntax error but the code doesnt work  ####!</li>
                <li> spend many hours on one problem is taxing, ask for help! </li>
            </ol>

            <h3> Plan of attack</h3>
            I'm going to reattempt traffic lights now that i better understand how to draw and clear a circle. Revisit moving circle but with rectangle. 
            and just keep going.

            <p>
                I'm delving into the world of tech. It's a long time coming. First week complete and i love it. 
                I'm working through <em>"how to design programs"</em>book. 
            </p>
                
            <p class="cursive-font">✨Here is my reflection of the learning.✨</p>

            <h3>Techy stuff</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Variables are a placeholder within a line of code </li>
                <li>composing functions are a fancy way of bringing through information that you have from another line of code </li>
                <li>camelCase is a style you write titles in </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Words of wisedom</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There are many different computing languages. Stick to one and learn the basics. </li>
                <li>computers are dumb, so you need to write commands for it to execute (when i heard this i questioned my intellect)</li>
                <li>day one bite the bullet and start writing code, it's not a spectator sport</li>
            </ol>
