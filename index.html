            <h2> Wave brain</h2>

            <p> The last two weeks I have learnt about Booleans, structures and making things move. Its interesting to know that you can compile different information into one file and <em> "name"</em> it. 
            There is a lot of be said about structures. I know that I've only touched the <em> tip of the iceberg</em> 
            Oh I've also learnt to move circles, but turning traffic lights "on and off" is work in progress. </p>

            <h3> class= cursive-font  Week of waving</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li> structures contain different types of information i.e. pixel : x,y coordinate, circle : coordinate, radius, colour </li>
                <li> Booleans only return true / false </li>
                <li> When composing function you must work from inner most bracket to outer</li>
                <li>  when placing a condition that has two functions you must return the first function with "true" so that you can envoke the 2nd function</li>
                <li> make an axillary function for when the code starts to become long; almost like <em> step by step </em> process </li>
            </ol>

            <h3> âœ¨ dark thoughts âœ¨</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li> moving a circle is more difficult than one anticipates </li>
                <li> the feeling when there's no syntax error but the code doesnt work  ####!</li>
                <li> spend many hours on one problem is taxing, ask for help! </li>
            </ol>

            <h3> Plan of attack</h3>
            I'm going to reattempt traffic lights now that i better understand how to draw and clear a circle. Revisit moving circle but with rectangle. 
            and just keep going. 

            <h2> So all in all this week was ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦ðŸš¥ ðŸš¦</h2>

            <p>
                I'm delving into the world of tech. It's a long time coming. First week complete and i love it. 
                I'm working through <em>"how to design programs"</em>book. 
            </p>
                
            <p class="cursive-font">âœ¨Here is my reflection of the learning.âœ¨</p>

            <h3>Techy stuff</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Variables are a placeholder within a line of code </li>
                <li>composing functions are a fancy way of bringing through information that you have from another line of code </li>
                <li>camelCase is a style you write titles in </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Words of wisedom</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There are many different computing languages. Stick to one and learn the basics. </li>
                <li>computers are dumb, so you need to write commands for it to execute (when i heard this i questioned my intellect)</li>
                <li>day one bite the bullet and start writing code, it's not a spectator sport</li>
            </ol>
