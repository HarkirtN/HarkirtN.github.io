            <h2> Braining out</h2>

            <h4>Difficulty has amped, brain has exploded</h4>
            <p>
                The sections have significantly amped in difficulty. 
                I have dipped into binary trees and binary search tress. the difference between the two is search trees are ordered,
                whereas regualr trees are not. Which is significant to understand when trying to find a number within the tree. 
                Bredth and depth are some strategies used to search within the tree once ordered. 
            
                <h4> different search strategies for a binary tree </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> bredth goes across the tree </li>
                    <li> depth goes down the tree </li>
                </ul>

                I will like to reattempt the binary tree exercises because I havent nailed these concepts or created a function that works.

       <p> This week has been about natural numbers. I understand that natural numbers is what we know as <em> just</em> numbers. <br> 
        I worked through several exercises where I was sorting lists, using primatives such as addition with natural numbers. <br>
        I struggled with this week's topic mostly attempting to tabulate items and counting from a limit. <br>
        I am determined to revisit this topic and attempt the exercises again.<br>

        <h2> Ride the brain wave </h2>
        <p> Revision week ! <br>
            I did a couple of finger exercises to revisit structures and lists. I feel these will be important for day to day tasks. <br>
            It always surprises me that i missed a critical comment within the book that would have helped me solve a problem. <br>
            <em> Hindsight is 20/20 </em> </p>

     <h3> ✨ Hindsight ✨ </h3>
     <ul> 
        <li> list using <code> (first (rest list))</code> read from innermost to outer </li>
        <li> Use nested conditional statements when you are asking questions about the first element of a list, with f/up q's</li>
        <li> To extract information you duplicate the list using <code> (cons ...)</code>with a condition infront that excludes an element </li>
        <li> To search for an element within a list you can use a sumbol and place it in a nested condition </li>
        <li> Understand the problem, if you find a keyword <strong> "ALL"</strong> place a guarded statment to <em> exit</em></li>
     </ul>

            <H2>Wavy's brainy</H2>
            <p> This week was full of conditions. I was practice exercises pertaining to extract items from inventory lists <br>
                and creating new lists from old lists. The thing I have come to understand is that when we create lists from lists, <br>
                we are just copying the 'OG" list and refining it. <br>
            Recursion was introduced in this section. I think of it as a loopity loop to help go through a list. </p>

             <h3> ✨Conditional thinking ✨</h3>   
             <ul>
                <li> Lists with multiple colomns can be defined as structures, then you can use selectors to extract/modify members. </li>
                <li> Utilise recursion for the <code> (rest list/inventory></code></li>
                <li> To eliminate members from OG list, simply add function that excludes using: <br> 
                    <blockquote> <code> (not ( first list/inv-list)</code> <br></blockquote> </li>
                <li> then construct new (first list/inventory) <br> </li>
                <blockquote> <code> (cons ( selector (first list/inventory)) (recursion function)</code></li></blockquote>
             </ul>

            <h2> Brainy's wavy </h2>
            <p> This week was great! I moved more circles and rectangles using "clear circle" and "draw circle" function. 
                I have understood the syntax and grammar within scheme. Structures are a bit more complicated when is comes to mixed data but i think of them like lists 
                - where we use certain selectors to retrieve information.</p>

            <h3> ✨ Vibes of the week ✨  </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> auxillary functions are my friend and you should utilise them in variable data i.e. predicates and structures using conditions</li>
                <li> predicates recognise a form of data i.e. ?number to recognise number</li>
                <li> predicates help distinguish between different data within the structures with conditions i.e finding square condition within a structure about different shapes </li>
                <li> use predicates to 'check' the function i.e. checked-area-of-disk output should be a number, therefore number? will be used as a condition </li>
                
            </ol>
            <h3> syntax and grammar </h3> 
            <h4> Core grammar</h4>
            <code> <blockquote>( define (non-empty sequence of variables) expression )</blockquote> <br> 
            <blockquote>( define ( function-name parameter/s) body</blockquote> <br>
            <blockquote>( function argument/s)</blockquote> <br>
            <blockquote>( cond (question answer) cond-clause cond-1 etc)</blockquote> <br>
            <blockquote>( define variable expression)</blockquote> <br>
            <blockquote>( define-struct variable (var-1 ...var-n)</blockquote></code> <br>
            
            <h4> core vacabulary </h4>
            <code> <blockquote>variable = any-name</blockquote> <br>
                    <blockquote>constants = boolean, symbols, numerals</blockquote> <br>
                    <blockquote>primitive = + | - </blockquote><br> 
                    <blockquote>expressions = variables, constants, primitives or functions & conditions</blockquote> </code> <br>

            <h2> Wave brain</h2>

            <p> The last two weeks I have learnt about Booleans, structures and making things move. Its interesting to know that you can compile different information into one file and <em> "name"</em> it. 
            There is a lot of be said about structures. I know that I've only touched the <em> tip of the iceberg</em> 
            Oh I've also learnt to move circles, but turning traffic lights "on and off" is work in progress. </p>

            <h3>  Week of waving</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li> structures contain different types of information i.e. pixel : x,y coordinate, circle : coordinate, radius, colour </li>
                <li> Booleans only return true / false </li>
                <li> When composing function you must work from inner most bracket to outer</li>
                <li>  when placing a condition that has two functions you must return the first function with "true" so that you can envoke the 2nd function</li>
                <li> make an axillary function for when the code starts to become long; almost like <em> step by step </em> process </li>
            </ol>

            <h3> ✨ dark thoughts ✨</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li> moving a circle is more difficult than one anticipates </li>
                <li> the feeling when there's no syntax error but the code doesnt work  ####!</li>
                <li> spend many hours on one problem is taxing, ask for help! </li>
            </ol>

            <h3> Plan of attack</h3>
            I'm going to reattempt traffic lights now that i better understand how to draw and clear a circle. Revisit moving circle but with rectangle. 
            and just keep going.

            <h2>Brain wave</h2>

            <p>
                I'm delving into the world of tech. It's a long time coming. First week complete and i love it. 
                I'm working through <em>"how to design programs"</em>book. 
            </p>
                
            <p class="cursive-font">✨Here is my reflection of the learning.✨</p>

            <h3>Techy stuff</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Variables are a placeholder within a line of code </li>
                <li>composing functions are a fancy way of bringing through information that you have from another line of code </li>
                <li>camelCase is a style you write titles in </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Words of wisedom</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There are many different computing languages. Stick to one and learn the basics. </li>
                <li>computers are dumb, so you need to write commands for it to execute (when i heard this i questioned my intellect)</li>
                <li>day one bite the bullet and start writing code, it's not a spectator sport</li>
            </ol>
