            I'm delving into the world of tech. It's a long time coming. First week complete and i love it. 
            I'm working through <em>"how to design programs"</em>book. 
        </p>
            
        <p class="cursive-font">✨Here is my reflection of the learning.✨</p>

        <p> <strong>Techy stuff</strong> </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Variables are a placeholder within a line of code </li>
            <li>composing functions are a fancy way of bringing through information that you have from another line of code </li>
            <li>camelCase is a style you write titles in </li>
        </ol>
    </body><p> <strong> Words of wisedom</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>There are many different computing languages. Stick to one and learn the basics. </li>
        <li>computers are dumb, so you need to write commands for it to execute (when i heard this i questioned my intellect)</li>
        <li>day one bite the bullet and start writing code, it's not a spectator sport</li>
    </ol>
